Leaderboards
============

This repository features three leaderboards to compare control methods:

* Simulation Leaderboard
* Robustness Leaderboard
* Hardware Leaderboard (Coming soon)

For further information and instructions on how to evaluate your own controller
see the linked descriptions.

The official leaderboards can be found at
`official leaderboards<https://dfki-ric-underactuated-lab.github.io/real_ai_gym_leaderboard/>`__ 

The repository is periodically checked for new controllers and the leaderboard is updated.
