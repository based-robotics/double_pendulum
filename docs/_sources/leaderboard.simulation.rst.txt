Simulation Leaderboard
======================

The simulation leaderboard compares the performance of different control
methods in simulation. The task for the controller is to swingup and balance
the acrobot/pendubot and keep the end-effector above the threshhold line..

The scripts for the leaderboard calculation can be found in
leaderboard/simulation/acrobot (pendubot is coming soon).

Creating the Leaderboard
------------------------

For creating the leaderboard locally, you can run::

  python create_leaderboard.py

This script will:

    1. Check for controllers in all files starting with 'con_'
    2. Check if the simulation data for these controllers already exists
    3. Generate the data if it does not exist
    4. Compute the leaderboard scores and save to a csv file


Leaderboard Parameters
----------------------

The leaderboard uses a fixed model of the double pendulum and fixed simulation parameters.
The parameters can be found in the `sim_parameters.py` file.

Evaluating your own controller
------------------------------

.. note::

   For implementing your own controller see `here
   <https://dfki-ric-underactuated-lab.github.io/double_pendulum/software_structure.controller.html>`__

If you want to evaluate your own controller and compare it to the listed
controllers on the leaderboard, you have to create a file with the name
`con_controllername.py`, where `controllername` should be the name of the method
your controller uses.

In that file you should create an instance of your controller with the name
`controller` (will be imported under this name from the other scripts).
Additionally, yout `con_controllername.py` file should contain a dictionary::

  leaderboard_config = {"csv_path": name + "/sim_swingup.csv",
                        "name": name,
                        "username": username}

where `name` is the `controllername` and `username` is your github username.

Feel free to import the model and simulation parameters from
`sim_parameters.py` if you need them to instantiate your controller.

You can now generate the simulation data by calling::

    python sim_controller.py con_controllername.py

This will simulate the double pendulum controlled by your controller and save
all relevant data in `data/controllername`.

To calculate the leaderboard scores for your controller do::

    python calculate_leaderboard_score.py con_controllername.py

If you create a pull request and your controller and the `con_controllername.py` 
is added to the main repository your controller will appear on the
`official leaderboard <https://dfki-ric-underactuated-lab.github.io/real_ai_gym_leaderboard/acrobot_simulation_leaderboard.html>`__ .
