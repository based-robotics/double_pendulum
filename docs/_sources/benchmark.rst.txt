Controller Benchmarking
=======================

As there are wildly different control methods it a natural intention to compare
and rate their motions.

For making the sim-to-real transfer easier, the controllers' robustness to
different disturbances in the form of noise of delays can be tested in
simulation.

Another comparison of controllers can be made based on criteria for fastest
swing-up, least cost-of-transport, etc. A leaderboard based on these criteria
is planed.
