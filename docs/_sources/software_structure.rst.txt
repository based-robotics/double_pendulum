Repository Structure
====================

Programming Language
--------------------

The main programming language of this library is python, but other languages
are also welcome. Besides python, there is a plant and a simulator as well as
an iLQR solver written in C++. The iLQR solver has python bindings so that
it can be used with the other components.

If you want to contribute something please use/create the folder in the ``src``
directory with the name of the used programming language.

Repository Overview
-------------------

The following overview covers the python code and the code which has python
bindings to be used in the same ecosystem. The repository is organized in
modules. The interplay of the modules is visualized in the figure below:

There are standardized interfaces and file formats for the communication
between the modules which are explained in the following.

Model Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The model parameters are the masses, lengths, ... of the double pendulum.
In this repository model parameters are stored in yml files. The keys of the
yml files are

- m1, m2, l1, l2, r1, r2, g, b1, b2, cf1, cf2, I1, I2, Ir, gr, tl1, tl2

While most classes and functions allow to directly set the model parameters in
the initialization/function calls most of the time it is more convenient to use
the model_parameters class. An object of that class stores all model
parameters, reads/writes yml files in the correct format and can be parsed to
most functions/classes in this library.

Some parameter sets are used so frequently (e.g. those that have been
identified for the real hardware) that they have been given names.
More precisely the name consists of a ``design`` and a ``model_id``.
The design refers to a hardware design where specific materials have be used.
The model_id refers to a set of model parameters which have been identified (or
estimated) for that design.
The naming convention for the design follows

- design_A.0, design_B.0, design_C.0, design_hD.0, ...

i.e. ``design_`` followed by a capital letter and a number. The number can
potentially used for minor changes in the design (such as different motor
units) in the future.  The h in front of the capital letter indicates that the
design is only hypothetical at the moment, i.e. it has not been realized with
real hardware.

The model_id format is

- model_1.0, model_1.1, model_2.0, model_3.0, ...

i.e. ``model_`` folowed by two integers. The first integer is the id which
identifies the model parameter set. The second integer can be used to simplify
the model.

- 0 refers to the full model
- 1 refers to the model where friction and motor inertia are set to 0

more simplified models may be used in the future.

Trajectory data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trajectories can be computed with trajectory optimization methods such as
direct collocation and iterative LQR. For the execution zhe trajectories can
later be loaded by a stabilizing controller such as time varying LQR of a model
predictive controller.
The computed trajectories are stored in a csv file. The first line of the csv
file is reserved for the header defining the data type in the corresponding
column. The headers used are:

- time
- pos1,pos2,vel1,vel2,
- acc1,acc2
- pos_meas1,pos_meas2,vel_meas1,vel_meas2
- pos_filt1,pos_filt2,vel_filt1,vel_filt2
- pos_des1,pos_des2,vel_des1,vel_des2
- tau_con1,tau_con2
- tau_fric1,tau_fric2
- tau_meas1,tau_meas2
- tau_des1,tau_des2
- K11,K12,K13,K14,K21,K22,K23,K24
- k1,k2

.. note:: 

    Not all headers/columns have to used.

.. note::

   There should be no space after the separating comma.

The easiest way to stay consistent with this format is to use the functions

.. code::

    save_trajectory(...)
    load_trajectory(...)
    load_trajectory_full(...)

in double_pendulum.utils.csv_trajectory. These functions use the panda library
to save/load the data. Missing header labels are skipped.

(Abstract) Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The controller class is central the this library as it has connections to
many other components. To ensure compatibility with all components, controllers
should always inherit from the abstract_controller class.
The abstract controller class can optionally do logging, state filtering,
friction compensation and gravity compensation.
Every specific controller, inheriting from the abstract controller class has
to implement a

.. code::

   controller.get_control_output_(self, x, t)

method, which should return an array-like object with shape=(2,) representing
the torques to be sent to the motors. The ``get_control_output_`` or more
precisely the ``get_control_output`` (without underscore) of the abstract
controller will be called by the simulator and the hardware control loop during
hardware experiments.
In addition to this function controllers can also have the methods

.. code::

   controller.init_(self)
   controller.reset_(self)

the ``init_()`` method will be called before the execution and ``reset_()`` can
be used to reset parameters inside the controller.
